# Dual Attention Network for Scene Segmentation - Group 16
In this blog, Duel Attention Network (DANet) will be explained, and a proposal for an architecture improvement will be given and evaluated. In 2019, Fu et al. published an article that introduces the DANet. This architecture is used for scene segmentation.
